## How people use GitHub (not just storing code)

* Searching uses of different functions
* Finding new packages
* Sharing work
* Package development!
* Following interesting people (social media, but way more fun!)
* Q & A through issues
* Substituting for a long work history (and serving as a technical resume)
* Keeping knowledge wikis
* Small, static websites
  * I host my blog through GitHub!

## What you need to use GitHub well

I usually interact through GitHub through the `shell`, but to start out I think it's easier to use a Git client. For the purposes of this exercise we will use [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

1. Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
3. Install [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
4. While you're at it, it's nice to have a good text editor. I highly recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## Let's create your first repository!

1. Navigate to the homepage on GitHub. It should look something like this layout (with much less text most likely)

2. Either click the green `New Repository` button on the right side of the screen or the `+` and `New repository` on the top of the screen. You should now see a screen that looks like this.
